# Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When one object (the subject) changes its state, all dependent objects (observers) are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is commonly used to implement distributed event-handling systems.

## Key Concepts

- **Subject**: The object that maintains a list of observers and notifies them of any state changes.
- **Observer**: The objects that are notified when the subject's state changes. They implement an interface to update their state in response to changes in the subject.
- **Concrete Subject**: A specific implementation of the subject that holds the actual state and sends notifications to observers.
- **Concrete Observer**: A specific implementation of an observer that reacts to updates from the subject.

## When to Use

- **State Synchronization**: When multiple objects need to stay in sync with the state of another object.
- **Event-Driven Systems**: In systems where changes in one object should trigger updates in other objects automatically.
- **Loose Coupling**: To reduce the direct dependency between the subject and observers, promoting loose coupling.
- **Dynamic Subscription**: When objects need the ability to dynamically subscribe or unsubscribe from updates.
- **Push-Based Notifications**: When you want to push updates to observers rather than having them poll for changes.

## Use Case

Use the Observer pattern when you have a scenario where one object's change needs to be automatically reflected across other dependent objects. It is particularly useful in scenarios like implementing event listeners, data-binding in UI frameworks, or any system where multiple components need to react to state changes in another component.
