# Factory Pattern

The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. This pattern is especially useful when the creation process is complex or when the system needs to choose among multiple derived classes.

## Key Concepts

- **Factory Method:** A method that returns an instance of a class, typically an interface or abstract class.
- **Concrete Products:** Classes that implement the interface or extend the abstract class.
- **Factory Class:** Contains the logic to decide which class to instantiate.

## When to Use

- **Runtime Object Type:** When the exact type of the object is not known until runtime.
- **Encapsulation of Object Creation:** To encapsulate the object creation process.
- **Loose Coupling:** To promote loose coupling by reducing dependencies on concrete classes.
- **Complex Creation Logic:** When the process of creating an object is complex and involves many steps.
- **Object Variations:** When there are multiple variations of an object that need to be created based on different conditions.
- **Centralized Control:** To centralize the control of the object creation process in a single class.
