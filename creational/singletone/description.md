# Singleton Design Pattern

The Singleton Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is particularly useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

## Key Concepts

- **Single Instance**: The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of the class is created. This is achieved by making the class constructor private and providing a static method to access the single instance.

- **Global Access**: The Singleton class provides a global point of access to its instance, which can be accessed from anywhere in the application.

- **Lazy Initialization**: The Singleton instance is created only when it is needed for the first time. This is known as lazy initialization.

- **Thread Safety**: In multithreaded environments, the Singleton pattern needs to handle synchronization to prevent multiple threads from creating multiple instances.

## When to Use

- **Controlled Access to Resources**: When a single instance of a class is needed to control access to a shared resource, such as a database or configuration settings.

- **Global Point of Access**: When you want to provide a single, global point of access to a particular resource or service.

- **Consistency**: When the class should ensure that only one instance is ever created, to maintain consistency and coordination.
